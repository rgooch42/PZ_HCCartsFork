Project Zomboid v.41 mod - A simple lift of the Hydrocraft carts and dollys due to HC not playing nice.

This is a breakout of the Wheelbarrow, Push Cart, Hand Dolly, Toy wagon, Pallet Truck, and Hand Dolly from Hydrocraft. It is not being actively developed, and no additional modifications are planned.

Other than modifying the code to not hijack Hydrocraft, none of the code for this addon belongs to me. All rights are reserved by the great folks associated at Hydrocraft: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=498441420
